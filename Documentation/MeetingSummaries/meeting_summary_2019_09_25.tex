\item Collect metals from the environment (pots, rocks, chests)
\item Small puzzles with iron and steel (Steppable platforms that open something like doors), Levers
\item Ruin can change words (give fake hints to the player) player gambles if it is worth going there (could have traps or very powerful enemies in these areas)
\item Death takes you a checkpoint
\item Climbable walls
\item Traps (pit with spikes)
\item If you run out of metals, go back to past place where you got the resources before (once you have run out it instantly restocks)
