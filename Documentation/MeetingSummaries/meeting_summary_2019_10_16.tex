\section{Meeting Duration}
60 Minutes

\section{Feedback}
We went over the feedback given by other teams regarding our presentation.

Important points:
\begin{description}
\item Good balance between calm and fight moments
\item Whenever there is an eery setting force the character to walk through it. Make sure the music is not too loud so you can hear the ambient noises.
\item Could make the chests (optional ones) contain notes explaining lore for example instead of extra metal.
\end{description}

\section{Cutscene}
Since they were far from Ruin's influence only some of the crew got corrupted. Started killing each other, he escapes the boat after it shipwrecks. 
First - boat being destroyed
Second - Castwaway into an abandoned village
Third - Goes into an empty house searching for answers
Zoom into character's face and eyes to show determination and the character.

\section{Pushing Pulling Idea}
Breakable windows/walls with pushed objects. Or pull an object towards you that is behind a wall and this breaks the wall for you.

\section{Other}
Demo of push pull mechanics from Ayush.
